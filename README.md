1. Student: I’m feeling very overwhelmed by all of the material in this program. It seems like every time I learn something new, I forget how to do everything else from before that. Right now I can’t even seem to figure out how to finish the first project. It’s not supposed to be this hard, is it? What do I do?


	A: Welcome to the community! I'm sorry to hear that you have some trouble with your learning. Don't worry. It happens a lot when we learn something new. We are here to help you out!

	1. What specific difficulties do you have when learning the material? Feel free to post questions on the forum. We will get your questions answered within 24 hours.

	2. You can schedule a 1 on 1 mentoring if you'd like to talk about the problems face to face. Here is [the link](https://udacity.com).

   
	Please let me know if you have further questions.
	
	TP: This happens a lot when learning something new. It's important to keep *empathic and compassionate* about students' situations and make them feel supported. Then ask them questions to *investigate the situation further*.  


2.  Student: I’m not sure how to do this. The question asks for the mean of the following numbers: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. How do I get the mean? How is that different from the average?

	A: A good question. To answer this question, we have to know what the mean is exactly. And [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) is always a good place to go when we have doubt. 
	
	   > The mean is **another name for the average**, which is defined to be equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations.
	
	Now that we know the definition of the mean, it's strait-forward to calculate it. And finally, I'd like to let you know there are other words, namely *median* and *mode*, which are used a lot with *mean*. Here is [a great video on this topic](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/data-distributions-a1/summarizing-center-distributions/v/statistics-intro-mean-median-and-mode) from Khan Academy. Enjoy it.
	
	TP: It's more important to teach students how to approach a problem, rather than giving them answers directly. And I think it makes sense to give them more resources to learn the concept better.


3. Mindset Reset.

	A: We don't have to be an expert to write down the first line of code.
	
	To be honest, I'm not confident to answer every question of my mentees. What's important for me is how to keep our students engaged and guide them to find the aha moments on their own. There is an old Chinese saying, the teacher is not necessarily better than students. It's true. I have some students now finish more NDs than me. As a mentor, we have to keep a growth mindset and learn with our students together.
	
	TP: As a mentor, one of our job is making sure the students have a growth mindset. We have to make it happen in ourselves first. As professor Dave Evans said in CS101, *stay udacious and keep learning!*


4.  Student: This is all so frustrating! I don’t think I can figure any of this out. I’ve gone over and over the videos in this course, but I’m just not getting it. Every time I sit down to work on the project, I just can’t seem to remember what to do next. I guess I’m just not cut out for engineering.

	A: I'm sorry to hear that. To be honest, you do learn something that you didn't realize. The project isn't supposed to be easy. In fact, it's designed to be challenging enough to help you learn better.
	
	Now, could you elaborate on where do you get stuck? Don't worry about the code first. Try to list the steps to do this project with plain text. What's the most difficult part in the steps do you think?
	
	TP: The student is in a bad situation. We have to to keep *empathic and compassionate* about it. Then we ask him/her some *open-ended questions* to help him/her think the problem further.

 

5.  Student: Every time I ask for help at Udacity, mentors just confuse me and won’t give me the answers I need. If I can’t figure something out, tell me the solution! What is wrong with you people?

	A: You may be surperised that it's done by intension. Please give me a chance to explain why we do this.
	
	There is an old Chinese saying, *to teach someone how to fish is better than giving him fishes*. We are here to guide our students through solving problems on their own, not to give them the answer directly. This is the way to help you master the skill of problem solving. You may feel painful at the very beginning, you will get the joy of solving problems on your own once you get it.

	TP: We can not give students answers directly due to some complaints. We have to follow the principles as a mentor.


6. Margot's Strawberries

	Part 1:
	Student: I am just staring at this word problem and have no idea how to start or what to do. I keep reading through it and glazing over and feeling lost. Help?

	Mentor prompt #1: It's fine. Please let me ask you some questions. What are the facts we've already known? What's the question we are trying to answer?
	
	TP: It's a very useful skill to ask students some open-ended questions to make them understand the problem better.

	Part 2:
	Student: Okay, so I have s = # strawberries, c = cost per strawberry in dollars, c = 7/18, and 8 = c * s. But now what?

	Mentor prompt #2: Great! We've already known *cost per strawberry* and the total money we have. Now suppose we can buy *s* strawberries with $8, then the equation `8 = c * s` must hold. Our job is to resolve this equation and get what `s` is.
	
	TP: Giving students some positive feedback to keep them engaged. And then rephrasing the simplify the problem.

	Part 3:
	Student: I have s = 144/7. Is that it?

	Mentor prompt #3: Almost. Do you remember we can not buy part of a strawberry? That means we have to round `s` to an integer. Oh, don't forget to ask for the drawbacks at the end. Okay, now let's come back to the original question, do you have some questions about the whole process?
	
	TP: Finally we will deal with the details easy to miss. Make the student to recap the whole process with a question and make sure him/her get the hang of it thoroughly.
